# hello-world
My first repository.
I am here to learn to develop an App to control a SMART home device product I am bringing to market. No coding experience.
I am a 50 year old futurist that fights a neuromuscular disorder and aspires to learn Â to work with the emerging technological future. I have worked in bail, education, machining, and environmental management. I consider myself a polymath and infinite learner. I am writing a book that tells of a frighteningly hopeful future.
