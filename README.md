# hello-world
My first repository. 
I am a 50 year old futurist that fights a neuromuscular disorder and aspires to learn Â to work with the emerging technological future. I have worked in bail, education, machining, and environmental management. I consider myself a polymath and infinite learner. I am writing a book that tells of a frighteningly hopeful future.
